## Building Dynamic External App Integrations

Integrator Hub empowers you to create dynamic external app integrations with minimal code. With this feature, you can connect your Automatisch instance to a wide range of applications without the need for extensive development work. Let's explore how this works.

### What are Dynamic External App Integrations?

Dynamic external app integrations in Automatisch allow you to seamlessly connect your workflows to external services, APIs, and applications. These integrations are dynamic in nature, meaning you can configure and manage them without writing extensive code. This flexibility is achieved through the Integrator Hub, a powerful tool that simplifies the integration process.

### Key Benefits


#### 1. No Code Required When Creating New Workflows

With dynamic external app integrations, you can add new connections to external services without writing custom code. This dramatically reduces the development overhead and accelerates your automation projects.

#### 2. Rapid Configuration

The Integrator Hub provides an intuitive interface for configuring integrations. You can set up authentication, define triggers and actions, and map data fields with ease.

#### 3. Extensibility

As new applications and services emerge, you can quickly adapt by adding integrations through the Hub. This extensibility ensures your workflows remain up-to-date and effective.

### Adding Custom Integrations With Minimal Code

While the Integrator Hub offers a wide range of pre-built integrations, you may encounter unique use cases that require custom connections. Integrator Hub allows you to build custom integrations when needed.
